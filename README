RankFu
======

RankFu is a plugin that allows you to add expressive user roles to your Rails App. 

Now it's easy to have separate moderators and admins, and define a role as a superset of another.

Another Disclaimer
==================

This plugin meets our simple needs, and has been extracted because we've needed the functionality several times, but it is by no means complete. 

If you encounter bugs or gaping holes in functionality , please contact me using my first name at my company, and I'll see what I can do.

RankFu uses Rails 2.1 style migrations. It shouldn't be too hard to create migrations manually if you are using <2.1.0.    


Example
=======
           
After installing this plugin, you'll want to start by performing some admin:

    #SETUP HERE#                                                     

After that, you'll probably want to add roles to your user model, so just add this line:

	knows_rank_fu

Now you can do the following: 

    User#has_role? 
    User#has_role
	User#"#{role}?"
 	User#"#{role}_exactly?"   #This forces an exact comparison, useful if you want to test for a role which has a superset (e.g. moderators and  administrators)
	User#"make_#{role}          
	User#"remove_#{role}" 

There is also some sugar for disabling users, to make your code more readable. These examples assume the existence of a role with :disabled as its key:
 
    User#disable_user 
    User#enable_user
    User#enabled?
